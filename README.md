## Introduction

This repository provides clear and concise C++ implementations of various DSA concepts. Each implementation is accompanied by explanations of the underlying principles and techniques involved. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository aims to help you understand and apply DSA effectively.

## Data Structures

Currently, the repository contains the implementation of:

- **Stack:** Explore the stack data structure, a fundamental concept in computer science. The implementation is provided in the `stack` folder, along with a detailed explanation of its properties and use cases.
- **Queue:** Discover the queue data structure, an essential concept in computer science. The implementation is provided in the `queue` folder, along with an in-depth explanation of its characteristics and applications.
- **Circular Queue:** Explore the Circular Queue data structure, which is a versatile variant of the traditional queue with cyclic behavior. In this example, we'll provide an implementation of the Circular Queue in the `circularqueue` folder, along with a comprehensive explanation of its features, and common applications.
- **Linear Search:** This algorithm involves sequentially scanning through an array to locate a specific element. It's straightforward and effective for smaller arrays or when the order of elements doesn't matter. The associated linear_search folder contains the implementation and an explanation. One might use linear search when dealing with shorter lists or unordered data, where simplicity takes precedence over performance.
- **Binary Search:** This method is tailored for efficiently searching sorted arrays. It continually divides the search range in half, which reduces the number of comparisons required to locate the desired element. The binary_search folder provides the algorithm's implementation and a detailed breakdown. Binary search is particularly valuable for larger datasets where speed matters, such as searching for words in a dictionary, names in a phone book, or dates in a sorted calendar.
- **Selection Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it into the correct position. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).The implementation is provided in the `selectionSort` folder.

More data structures will be added soon!

## Algorithms

Coming soon: a diverse array of algorithm implementations, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming solutions, and more. Each algorithm will be presented with a step-by-step explanation of its logic, followed by a well-commented C++ implementation.
